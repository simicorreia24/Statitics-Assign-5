# STATISTICS ASSIGNMENT NO. 5

# Question 1
#  We throw two dice. Let A be the event “the sum of the points is 7”, B the event “die #1
# came up 3”, and C the event “die #2 came up 4”. Now, P[A] = P[B] = P[C] = 1/6.
# Also,
# P[A ∩ B] = P[A ∩ C] = P[B ∩ C] = 1/36
# so that all events are pairwise independent. However,
# P[A ∩ B ∩ C] = P[B ∩ C] = 1/36
# while
# P[A]P[B]P[C] = 1/216
# so they are not independent as a triplet.
# First, note that, indeed, P[A ∩ B] = P[B ∩ C] = 1/36, since the fact that A and B occurred is the same as the fact that B and C occurred.
# 
# Question 2.
#  Let G represents green marble and B represents blue marble. 
# According to the question, after putting a green marble in the bag,  Let already present marble in the bag is green. Then, after taking green marble. 
# Probability that the remaining marble is also green =1
#  Let already present marble in the bag is blue, then after taking green marble. 
# Probability that the remaining marble is also green = 0
#  So, required probability =0+1=1
